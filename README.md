# Rewriting

This repository emerged from the book Term Rewriting and All That by Nipkow and Baader. We followed closely a little term 
rewriter written in Haskell by Manuel Eberl. 

There are a number of ways you can contribute to this project:

- Implementing completion.
- Verifying the code using Stainless verifier. You may want to have a look at the Bolts project. 
- Proposing new term rewriting strategies that may be useful for a software verifier to have. 

You may be interested at the IsaFoR/CeTA system (at least we are)
